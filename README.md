- 👋 Hi, I’m @raqib02: A CyberSecurity student.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing games in C++ and assembly. And providing security features for games, apps, management systems, and all other type of software. I also like to script tools used in ethical hacking and pentesting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in python and penetration testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding in C++, Assembly Language, Python, and CyberSecurity. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: Newbie to coding and cybersecurity (not a fun fact)
